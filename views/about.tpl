<p>PingPanther is a simple alternative to fancy network monitoring systems, ie. OpenNMS, Nagios, Zabbix, and so on. Instead of full network monitory, autodiscovery, cpu/memory footprints/auto-recovory steps and so on, the Panther just let's you know when your site goes down via email/sms.  By trimming down what the program does, we've kept the installation and setup stupid simple.

From day one PingPanther has the easiest setup (drop in your cgi-bin), small download, and full GUI configuration. Just add a cron and you have a reliable solution that can be ran on any server, and even budget hosts like DreamHost, Bluehost, Hostgator.

This project is a fork of Monithor, a project by Pulsh.com. They did great work, and we are continuing the open source momentum they created.
